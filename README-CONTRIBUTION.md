## Contributor Guide
This guide should give a first orientation for using an AI coding assistance productively:

✓ do improve the introduction chapters to AI (but keep it simple)<br>
✓ do add documentation and examples to this project<br>
✓ do provide links to similar projects / other sources of knowledge by Worldliners<br>
✘ do not directly add content to master<br>
✓ do create feature branches that can be discussed and merged<br>
